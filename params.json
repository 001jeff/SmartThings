{"name":"SmartThings","tagline":"A repository for my SmartThings apps and items related to them","body":"### Welcome to Michael Struck's GitHub Page.\r\nThank you for visiting my GitHub Repository. In January 2015, I purchased my first SmartThings hub and light switch and I was hooked! I immediately equipped both of my houses with multiple devices, and learned the SmartThings Groovy code so I could create my own unique applications. Others have found these useful, so I wanted to share them with the world.\r\n\r\n<I>Please contribute to the development of these app by making donation via PayPal.</I>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4B3KESKC4FXLA\r\n\"><img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif\" alt=\"PayPal\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n### Application Licenses\r\nUnless otherwise stated, all applications are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\").\r\nYou may not use these files except in compliance with the License.
